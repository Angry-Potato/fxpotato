# FxPotato

The Foreign Exchange currency rates looker-upper. Potato style.

Uses last daily feed from European Central Bank website, and exposes a simple interface to get the conversion rates for one currency to another on a given day.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fxpotato'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fxpotato

### Configuration
FxPotato takes rates from the [ECB website](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml).

To change the feed, set the `FXPOTATO_DATA_SOURCE_URL` environment variable to the new URL, and if the structure of the xml is different (or indeed not XML at all, which is also totes cool), set `FxPotato.repo` to equal an instance of a custom class of your own writing for locating rates in the new structure. Make sure to set `FxPotato.repo = YourClass.new` before you use the other functionality in `FxPotato`.

The `repo` class you write must implement the `find` method with this signature:

```
def find(date = Date object, currency = Currency key, e.g. 'GBP')
  // your wonderful code here
end
```

If using the crontab functionality, configure your own schedule by editing the `config/schedule.rb` file, as per the [whenever documentation](https://github.com/javan/whenever#example-schedulerb-file).

## Usage
### CLI
Get foreign exchange rates on the command line with the following command:

```
fxpotato getrate <base_currency> <target_currency> -d <YYYY-MM-DD>

e.g.
fxpotato getrate GBP USD -d 2017-06-02
```

The `-d` option is not required, and will default to today if not specified.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
